                <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
                  <h2>1.1 BridgeAPI</h1>
                  <p>
                      BridgeAPI is a free, open source web developer tool that receives, filters and forwards HTTP requests. This combination allows developers to set up event-driven workflows in a few simple steps with BridgeAPI as the bridge between apps. 
                  </p>

                  <h2>1.2 The API Economy</h2>
                  <p>
                      Propelled by the rise in microservices, cloud computing, Internet of Things, and the general benefits of integrating diverse business applications, the API space has grown exponentially since especially the mid 2000s. ProgrammableWeb, a directory that lists public web-based APIs, documents a growth of 2000 APIs yearly to more than 23,000 by 2019 (https://www.programmableweb.com/news/apis-show-faster-growth-rate-2019-previous-years/research/2019/07/17). Postman, the most used developer API tool, registered a ten-fold rise in API request folders, from 3.1 to 34.9 million between 2017 and 2020 (https://blog.postman.com/api-growth-rate/). The integral role API requests plays in the budding API economy demands tools for developers to send, receive, monitor and chain API requests. 
                  </p>

                  <h2>1.3 Current Tools</h2>
                  <p>
                      Among developer tools used to send API requests, Postman is by far the most utilized.
                  </p>
                  <img />
                  <p>
                      It lets users select the request type and endpoint along with a host of optional settings including parameters, headers and body. It even allows for pre-request scripts whereby a request can be delayed or more advanced features like regularly scheduled requests. The response is subsequently rendered with corresponding status, time, size and boy among other data. Postman is very intuitive to use and practically covers every conceivable aspect of an API request, yet it is limited in so far that any workflow involving Postman must originate with a Postman request, making it more useful as a testing tool for an API interface. Any need to integrate workflows triggered by webhooks will therefore require other tools. 
                  </p>

                  <p>There are also practical tools to receive API requests.</p>
                  <img />
                  <p>
                      Webhook.site is one such tool that provides a URL endpoint to receive webhooks which can then be inspected upon reception. Users can configure an automatic response that can be hard coded or include data from the incoming request.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Lastly, there are apps that provide for workflows by providing URL endpoints that, when pinged, trigger a user-defined workflow. Zapier, IFTTT and Pipedream are examples within this category.
                  </p>

                  <img />

                  <p>
                     These fully-fledged sites are built to integrate large numbers of predefined apps, which are selected with a click and the granting of permission to access the external app from the workflow site. With this access granted, any number of events (in addition to webhooks) within the external app can trigger the user-defined workflow. These sites are therefore popular with retail users since the intricacies of API requests are abstracted away. Furthermore, these sites are proprietary, involving a limited free tier and scaled paid tiers.
